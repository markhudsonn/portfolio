## Overview
Reordering was previously a manual process, using VLOOKUPs for multiple Excel sheets each time for over 2,000 products. The process was time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult for others to carry out. The ERP system did not have the functionality to produce the required reports.

## Outcomes
- Excel manual work replaced with a single, real-time report
- More accurate reordering as backorder date can be filtered and each item factors in the manufacturer lead time
- Better stock levels as process can be carried out more frequently
- Approximately 6 Weeks annually saved for reordering in the UK alone
- Allows stock movement from UK to USA to easily be calculated. A rapidly growing part of the business.
