## Overview
This topic is of interest to me as it crosses two of my passions: football and data science/coding. The example sport is therefore football, but the same principles can be applied to any sport.

## Factors affecting outcome
To create a model to predict the outcome of a match, we need to consider a variety of factors.

### Big Factors
- Home advantage
- Starting line-up
- Form

### Other Factors
- Head-to-head record
- Fitness/time since last match
- Weather
- Referee

### Uncommon Factors
- Technical failures (e.g. VAR)
- Object thrown onto pitch
- Team internal issues (e.g. player disputes)

## Issues with modelling

### Data availability & reliability

Acquiring extensive data is costly and labor-intensive, given the sheer number of games and variables involved. It's impractical to collect this manually, so paid services can be used. These are often expensive.

### Randomness & unpredictability

At the end of the day, football is a game. There are many factors that are impossible to predict, such as a red card or a player getting injured, so it's impossible to create a model that is 100% accurate. Models therefore usually predict the outcome with a probability, rather than a definitive result.

## Why model outcomes?

The gambling industry is a huge, global market of over $100 billion. The rapidly growing sports betting market is expected to double by 2030. If a model can predict outcomes with a high degree of accuracy to outperform the odds set by bookmakers, it can be used to make money.
